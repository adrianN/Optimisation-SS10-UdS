What you're reading right now are lecture notes taken during the Optimisation class. Most likely this script is riddled with errors so take everything with an appropriate dose of salt. Send the authors emails or patches if you find errors or have some clarifications. 

The books recommended on the course website seem to be really good. You should read them instead of this.

These notes are released under a Creative Commons Attribution--Noncommercial--Share-Alike licence. So you can do pretty much everything with them as long as you mention the original authors, don't sell your work and distribute it under an equivalent licence. Read the licence agreement for details. Although the licence does not request it the authors would be happy if you noticed us should you decide to use this.
